## Third year project on 'Independence Analysis in a Markov Chain Model'
Markov Chain models are often used in practice to model discrete events that occur consecutively. Examples include systematic failures in loan payments and occurrence of economic recessions. <br>
This project is seperated into three parts. <br>
First, simulating data from a ﬁrst order Markov Chain model. <br>
Second, estimating this model using Metropolis Hastings algorithm. <br>
Last, assessing the performance of the Metropolis Hastings algorithm that I have deﬁned.
